# findchord
A game to practice music chord reading.
Base on :
- Vex flow http://www.vexflow.com/ to display scores
- Web Audio API to sound generation
- https://www.w3.org/TR/webmidi/ to listen piano keyboard input

Tested only on Chrome (and probably working only) 

Many thanks to follwing site for their great examples:
